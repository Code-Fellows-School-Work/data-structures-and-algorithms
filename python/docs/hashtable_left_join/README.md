# Hastable Left Join

Input: (1) hashmap with keys as strings and values as strings, (2) hashmap with keys as strings and values as strings
Output: Data structure with left join logic

## Approach & Efficiency
O(N) for space and time. Each lookup and append operation is O(1) but iterating through each element is an O(N) operation.
