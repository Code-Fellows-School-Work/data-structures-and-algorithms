# Stack-Queue Psuedo
Write a class that takes in two stacks as parameters and instantiates a queue using the nodes from the two stacks. Within the class, write two methods enqueue and dequeue that perform FIFO oeprations.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
O(1) the time and memory to complete the algorithm scales at a constant rate as the size of the stacks and queues increases
