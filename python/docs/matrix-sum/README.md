# Matrix Sum
Write a function called matrixSum and given a matrix, returns the sum of each matrix row

## Whiteboard Process
[Matrix Sum](/python/docs/matrix-sum/matrixSum.PNG)

## Approach & Efficiency
Employs a linear approach to finding the sum of each row within a given matrix. Larger the matrix then the more time and space required to complete to algorithm which grows at a linear rate.

## Solution
Did not write the code because it's whiteboard only.
