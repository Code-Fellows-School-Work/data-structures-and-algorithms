# Array Binary Search
Write a function called binary_search which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.  Return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
Employs a logrithmic approach to searching if the value of the search key exists in the sorted array.

## Solution
Did not write the code because it's whiteboard only.
