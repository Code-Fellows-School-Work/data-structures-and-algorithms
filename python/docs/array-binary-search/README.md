# Array Binary Search
<!-- Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Return an array with the new value added at the middle index. -->

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- [Array Binary Search Whiteboard](/python/docs/array-insert-shift/insertShiftArray.PNG) -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- Employs a linear approach by appending the inserted value to the end of the array then verifying it's placement within the array to the middle index. If the inserted value is the middle index, stop and return the array. If the inserted value is not the middle index, then swap it's position with the next element over and check again if the inserted value is the middle index. Repeat until the inserted value is the middle index then return array. -->

## Solution
Did not write the code because it's whiteboard only.
