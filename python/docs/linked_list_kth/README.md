# Linked List Kth
Write a method for the Linked List class that takes in a number, k, and returns the k places from the tail of the linked list

## Whiteboard Process
[Linked-List-Kth](/python/docs/linked_list_kth/linked-list-kth-from-end.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n) because traversing through linked list to find the tail then backgwards to find index = k has n time complexity where the value of n increases as the size of the linked list increases
