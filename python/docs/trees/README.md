# Tree Max
Write an method for the Binary Tree class to find the maximum value. Accepts no arguments and returns a number

## Whiteboard Process
[Tree Max](/docs/tree_max/tree_max.PNG)

## Approach & Efficiency
The algorithm will need to traverse the entire tree to determine the max value, therefore it's big O(n) for space and time
